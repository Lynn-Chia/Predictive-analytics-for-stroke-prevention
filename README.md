# Predictive Analytics for Stroke Prevention

## Project Overview
This project, developed by Team 4 for BC2407 Analytics 2 at Nanyang Technological University, focuses on developing an early detection model for stroke using machine learning techniques. By integrating this model into Singapore's healthcare system, our aim is to empower individuals and healthcare professionals with tools to predict and therefore prevent stroke occurrences, significantly reducing the stroke incidence rate in Singapore.
